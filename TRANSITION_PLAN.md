# Career Transition Plan

*Chief Engineer → AI/Infrastructure | DP*
*Created: December 2025*

---

## The Pitch (30 seconds)

> "I'm a Chief Engineer with 16 years keeping ships alive. I build AI tools for blue collar workers - people who can't just 'refresh the page' when things break. I've shipped production software that my crew uses daily, in environments with spotty internet and zero margin for error. I bring systems thinking, safety mindset, and the ability to translate 'we need 99.9% uptime' into engineering reality."

---

## Why This Matters

**The gap I see:** Maritime and industrial workers are behind on technology. They defer to reliability over innovation, are intimidated by AI, and take forever to approve even obsolete equipment. Meanwhile, AI has lowered barriers to building custom applications that could solve real problems.

**My drive:** Help "blue collar workers of all stripes" realize AI isn't intimidating and can be practical. Lower the barrier between "I have a problem" and "I have a tool that solves it."

**My edge:** I'm not a tech person pretending to understand operations. I *am* operations. I understand failure modes, inspection pressure, compliance burden, and what happens when software breaks and you're 200 miles from shore.

---

## Target Roles (Priority Order)

### 1. Forward Deployed AI / AI Solutions Engineer
**Why it fits:** Customer-facing builder. Requirements in messy environments, stakeholder wrangling, field realities, shipping under constraints. It's "chief engineer, but for AI deployments."

**Example postings:**
- Salesforce: "AI Forward Deployed Engineer" (travel, regulated industries, conversational AI)
- Lockheed Martin: "Forward Deployed AI/ML Engineer Sr" (customer liaison + productionizing ML)

**Interview angle:** "I've shipped safety-critical systems under inspection pressure, with downtime costing real money. I can do the same with AI, and I won't hallucinate my way through an incident review."

**Gap to close:** More hands-on with deployment pipelines, customer-facing communication polish

---

### 2. ML/MLOps Engineer (Maritime/Defense/Industrial Edge)
**Why it fits:** MLOps is ops. Monitoring, reliability, deployment pipelines, failures, telemetry, constraints, compliance. That's my life already, with fewer oil stains.

**Example posting:**
- Anduril: "Senior ML/MLOps Engineer - Maritime Digital Production" (explicitly maritime-focused, deploying and sustaining AI systems)

**Interview angle:** "I understand instrumentation, failure modes, maintenance cycles, and why uptime beats demos. I can translate requirements into engineering reality."

**Gap to close:** CI/CD pipelines, monitoring/observability tools, containerization deeper than basics

---

### 3. AI Product Manager (Industrial/IoT/Operations)
**Why it fits:** Already do product work - prioritization, tradeoffs, roadmap-by-constraint, user feedback loops, risk management. PM for AI needs someone who can say "no" intelligently.

**Example posting:**
- "Senior AI Product Manager Innovation & IoT Solutions"

**Interview angle:** "I've run real operational roadmaps where the users can't just 'refresh the page' when things break."

**Gap to close:** Formal PM frameworks, stakeholder communication at enterprise level

---

## Portfolio Strategy

### Narrative Arc
**Theme:** "Marine engineer building AI tools for blue collar workers in constrained environments"

Each project should demonstrate:
1. Real problem from real domain experience
2. Practical solution (not theoretical)
3. Production mindset (error handling, offline capability, user feedback)
4. Constraint awareness (bandwidth, technical literacy of users, compliance)

### Current Projects → Positioning

| Project | Current State | Portfolio Value | Action Needed |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|---------------|
| **ship-MTA-draft** | ✅ Production, real users | HIGH - proves you ship | Clean up README, add screenshots, document user feedback |
| **oil_record_book_tool** | ✅ MVP complete | HIGH - domain expertise + practical AI | Polish, deploy, document |
| **CFR/ABS Search** | ? | HIGH - domain expertise + practical AI | Ensure it's polished, add to portfolio |
| **Dry-dock Tracker** | ? | MEDIUM - operational tooling | Document the problem it solves |
| **Reality-layer** | Demo-ready | MEDIUM - shows vision | Either ship MVP or archive. Don't let it languish. |
| **AgentOrchestratedCodeFactory** | Complete but unused | LOW - "factory trap" | Archive or actually generate something with it |
| **multi-agent-workflow** | v2.0.0 released | MEDIUM - cutting edge patterns | Good for technical credibility |

## Skills Gap Analysis

### Strong (Leverage These)
- ✅ Systems thinking, failure modes, redundancy
- ✅ Production mindset (real users, real consequences)
- ✅ Domain expertise (maritime, industrial operations)
- ✅ Constraint awareness (offline, low-bandwidth, non-technical users)
- ✅ Python basics, Flask, API integration
- ✅ Prompt engineering, RAG patterns
- ✅ Multi-agent concepts

### Working On (Your current learning areas)
- 🟡 Git fluency (daily ops good, edge cases need work)
- 🟡 Understanding generated code deeply
- 🟡 iOS/Swift (Reality-layer work)
- 🟡 Testing patterns (pytest)

### Gaps to Close (Priority order for target roles)

**For Forward Deployed / Solutions Engineer:**
1. **Cloud deployment** - Get comfortable deploying beyond Railway. Try AWS/GCP free tier.
2. **Customer communication** - Document your work as if explaining to a client, not just devs
3. **Integration patterns** - How to connect AI to existing enterprise systems

**For MLOps:**
1. **CI/CD pipelines** - GitHub Actions for real projects, not just tutorials
2. **Containerization** - Docker fluency, basic Kubernetes concepts
3. **Monitoring/Observability** - Logging, metrics, alerting patterns
4. **ML fundamentals** - Don't need to train models, but understand eval, drift, retraining

**For AI PM:**
1. **PRD writing** - Formal product requirements docs
2. **Stakeholder management** - Enterprise communication patterns
3. **Metrics/Analytics** - How to measure AI product success

## Certifications

### Google Cloud Professional ML Engineer ⬜ Target
**Why:** Signals deployment/infrastructure competence, addresses MLOps skills gap
**Cost:** ~$200 exam fee + study materials
**Timeline:** 4-8 weeks of study
**Value:** Recognized credential, directly relevant to MLOps track, covers CI/CD and monitoring concepts
**Resources:**
- Google's ML Engineer learning path (free)
- Coursera GCP ML specialization
- Practice exams

**When to pursue:** After oil_record_book_tool is deployed and portfolio is polished (don't let cert studying delay shipping)
