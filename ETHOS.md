# My Development Ethos

*DP - Chief Engineer transitioning to AI/Infrastructure*

## Core Philosophy

**"Vibe coding with intention"** - Use AI to generate code, but understand what it generates. Move fast, but build real understanding over time.

### What I Believe

1. **Working > Perfect** - Ship something that works, iterate from there
2. **Systems thinking transfers** - My 16 years of marine engineering taught me to think in components, flows, failure modes. Software is the same.
3. **Learn by doing** - I pick things up by building, not by reading tutorials
4. **Compound knowledge** - Each project should make the next one easier
5. **Production mindset** - Real users (my crew) depend on my code. That keeps me honest.

### What I'm Building Toward

- Career transition from marine engineering to AI/infrastructure roles
- GitHub portfolio that demonstrates practical problem-solving
- Expertise in multi-agent systems and AI-assisted development
- Tools that work in constrained environments (offshore, low-bandwidth)

## Development Principles

### Code

- **Readability over cleverness** - Code should be obvious
- **Type hints always** (Python) - Future me will thank present me
- **Explicit over implicit** - Say what you mean
- **Handle errors properly** - Never fail silently

### Git

- **Conventional commits** - `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `chore:`
- **Commit often** - Small, logical chunks
- **Never mention AI in commits** - The code stands on its own
- **Feature branches** for anything non-trivial

### Projects

- **README first** - If I can't explain it simply, I don't understand it
- **Flat structure** - Don't over-nest directories
- **Tests for critical paths** - Not 100% coverage, but the stuff that matters
- **Deploy early** - Get it running somewhere real

## Anti-Patterns I Avoid

- ❌ Overengineering simple problems
- ❌ Collecting tools I don't use
- ❌ Starting new projects before finishing current ones
- ❌ AI slop - accepting generated code without understanding it
- ❌ Burning tokens on unfocused conversations
- ❌ Premature optimization

## What Works For Me

### Communication with AI
- Direct and concise - skip the preambles
- Code-first - show me, don't describe
- Engineering analogies help me grasp new concepts
- Iterate fast - working prototype beats perfect plan

### Learning Style
- "Serial master" - deep dive into one domain, get competent, move on
- Hands-on application over theory
- Document decisions for future reference
- Ask "why this pattern?" when reviewing generated code

### Workflow
- Fresh context for each task (prevents token bloat)
- Structured phases for complex work
- Desktop Commander for file operations
- Claude Projects for domain-specific context

## Honest Assessment

### Strong At
- Systems thinking and architecture
- Breaking down complex problems
- Seeing connections across domains
- Pragmatic decision-making
- Getting things to production

### Working On
- Git fluency (the commands, the workflow)
- Understanding generated code deeply
- Knowing when to stop iterating
- Python patterns and idioms
- Frontend development

### Accepting
- I won't master everything
- AI dependency is a trade-off, not a failure
- Impostor syndrome is normal during transition
- Some AI-generated code will be slop - that's what review is for
