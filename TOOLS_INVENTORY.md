## MCPs (Model Context Protocol)

### Desktop Commander ✅ ESSENTIAL
**Purpose:** File system operations, process management, search
**Use for:** Creating files, reading directories, running commands
**Status:** Using daily, works well

### Others Available
- Figma - have it, rarely use
- Notion - connected but not actively using
- Hugging Face - available for model search
- Chrome control - available

**Note:** Don't need more MCPs right now. Master what I have.

## What I Should Learn Better

### Priority 1 (Now)
- [ ] Git workflow - branching, merging confidently
- [ ] Actually running my projects locally
- [ ] Python debugging (not just AI-assisted)

### Priority 2 (Soon)
- [ ] pytest patterns - writing effective tests
- [ ] Flask deeper understanding
- [ ] Basic Docker for deployment

### Priority 3 (Later)
- [ ] Cursor advanced features
- [ ] CI/CD pipelines
- [ ] Kubernetes basics

---

## Tools I'm NOT Using (and that's fine)

- Complex CI/CD (GitHub Actions basics are enough for now)
- Kubernetes (overkill for my projects)
- Multiple cloud providers (Railway works)
- Dozen MCPs (Desktop Commander covers 90%)
- AI model fine-tuning (using APIs is fine)
