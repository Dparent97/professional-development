# Professional Development

*My personal engineering handbook - context for Claude Projects*

## Purpose

This folder contains my development philosophy, learnings, and project context. It's designed to be added to a Claude Project so Claude has persistent context about:

- How I like to work
- What I'm building
- What I've learned
- Where I'm trying to go

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `ETHOS.md` | My development philosophy and principles |
| `GIT_CHEATSHEET.md` | Git commands I actually need |
| `TOOLS_INVENTORY.md` | What tools I'm using and why |
| `ACTIVE_PROJECTS.md` | Current state of my projects |
| `LEARNINGS.md` | Key lessons from building with AI |
| `RESOURCES.md` | Links and references |
| `PROGRESS_JOURNAL.md` | Session logs and insights |

## How to Use

### As Claude Project Knowledge
1. Create a new Claude Project (e.g., "Professional Development")
2. Add these .md files to the project knowledge
3. Chat naturally - Claude has context about my work style, projects, and goals

### As Git Repo
This is also a git repo at `/Users/dp/Projects/professional-development`. Claude can:
- Read files directly with Desktop Commander
- Update files (like PROGRESS_JOURNAL.md) via skills
- Push changes to GitHub

### Periodic Reviews
Ask Claude to:
- "Review my ACTIVE_PROJECTS.md - anything I should prioritize?"
- "Look at my ethos and check if [repo] aligns with it"
- "What patterns should I add to LEARNINGS.md based on our conversation?"

### Keep It Updated
- Add new learnings as they emerge
- Update project status when things change
- Capture useful resources as I find them

## What This Replaces

The failed `programming-mentorship` repo idea. That was a static curriculum with no content. This is a living document that accumulates context over time.

## Philosophy

> "Learn by doing, document as you go, compound knowledge across projects."
